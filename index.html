                                        <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting or unusual experience. It may also be a bold, usually risky undertaking, with an uncertain outcome. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, river rafting, or participating in extreme sports. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial, or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.
                                                            Adventure fills in thrill in our lives. There are many ways to indulge in adventure. Different people like different adventurous activities. Some of these ways are mentioned below:

                                        <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>        
                                        </div>
                                        <p class="text">Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.

                                                            If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.
                                                            
                                                            You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
                                                            
                                                            If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain.
                                                            
                                                            Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.
                                                            
                                                            Plan to get on your bike and ride for 30-60 minutes, 3-5 days a week.
                                                            
                                                            Start every ride with a warm-up. Pedal at a slow, easy pace for 5-10 minutes. Then boost your speed so you start to sweat. If you’re riding a stationary bike, simply change the settings for a faster pace.
                                                            
                                                            When you’re ready to wrap things up, take an extra 5 minutes to cool down by cycling at a slower pace.

                                        Intensity Level: High
Cycling gets your heart rate up almost as much as running and burns a lot of calories. It's also gentle on your body. It doesn't put a lot of stress on your joints, which helps if you’re getting into shape or have joint problems.

Areas It Targets
Core: Yes. Your core will get stronger from biking.

Arms: No. This workout doesn't specifically target your arms.

Legs: Yes. This is a great workout for your legs, especially your quads and hamstrings.

Glutes: Yes. Your glutes and hips will get a serious workout from biking.

Back: No. This workout doesn’t specifically target your back. If you want to add an upper body workout, try mountain biking. It will engage your back muscles as you navigate up and down hills.

Type
Flexibility: No. This workout doesn’t focus on flexibility.
Aerobic: Yes. Biking is a powerful cardio workout.
Strength: Yes. The large muscles of your lower body will get a boost in strength from biking.
Sport: Yes, if you're competing in a race.
Low-Impact: Yes. This is a workout that doesn’t put stress on your joints.

   <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text">Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.

                                        The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached. Usually a speed of about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough to launch the craft. Paragliders may also be launched from flatland by towing, either with a winch or behind a vehicle.

                                        <br><br><br>
                                        The sport can be traced to the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who tow-launched his advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in the early 1960s with the kite and parachute designs of the Canadian-born American inventor Domina Jalbert. These designs evolved into steerable rectangular parachutes with relatively high forward speed. It was soon found that they had sufficient glide performance to allow them to be launched from steep slopes as well as by the aircraft deployment usual for parachutists.

                                        <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text">Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th century.

                                        In the early 20th century, however, concomitant with the development of Hawaii as a tourist destination, surfing underwent a revival, and the sport quickly spread to California and Australia. Key to this diffusion were the American writer Jack London and the Hawaiian surfers George Freeth and Duke Kahanamoku. After visiting Waikiki, London published several accounts of surfing in popular American magazines; in 1907 the American industrialist Henry Huntington hired Freeth, whom he billed as the “man who can walk on water,” to help promote his new railway line to Redondo Beach. Surfing thus took hold in California. A few years later, after Kahanamoku won the 100-metre freestyle event at the 1912 Olympic games, swimming officials from New South Wales invited him to Australia to demonstrate his swimming and surfing styles. In 1914 and 1915 Kahanamoku thrilled crowds in Sydney with his wave-riding skills, thus helping to establish the sport in Australia as well.
